Contributing
============

If you would like to contribute, get in touch!
The best way to do this is through `Github Issues <https://github.com/PGijsbers/GAMA/issues>`_.

If you are interested in adding or improving something unlisted, open a new issue first.
Describe the planned contribution to see if it fits within our vision of the package,
and for discussion on its implementation.
If you want to start working on an open issue, comment on the issue first to make sure no double work is done.

Either way, work on your contribution on a separate branch created from the latest development branch.
When finished, make sure all the unit tests work and the documentation is updated before submitting a pull request.
In the pull request, mention the issue that discusses the contribution and please mention any additional information
that might be useful for reviewing the changes.

To ensure a pleasant environment for everyone, we ask that all our contributors adhere to the [code of conduct](https://github.com/PGijsbers/gama/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md).
