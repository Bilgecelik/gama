Benchmark Results
=================

.. note::  Additional results will be uploaded soon.

This page reports the benchmark results obtained by running GAMA on the `AutoML benchmark <https://openml.github.io/automlbenchmark/automl_overview.html>`_.
Note that the performance of other AutoML frameworks is taken from the original benchmark experiments, they are not reproduced by us.
Some results on this page may have been performed on other hardware than aws nodes, but care is taken that the resources available match.
We will do our best to keep the results complete and up to date.
