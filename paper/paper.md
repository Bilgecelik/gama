# Summary

This is a test.
This is a reference [@Olson2016EvoBio].
JOSS welcomes submissions from broadly diverse research areas. 
For this reason, we request that authors include in the paper some sentences that would explain the software functionality
 and domain of use to a non-specialist reader. Your submission should probably be somewhere between 250-1000 words.

In addition, your paper should include:

    A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience
    A clear statement of need that illustrates the purpose of the software
    The software should have an obvious research application
    A list of key references including a link to the software archive
    Mentions (if applicable) of any ongoing research projects using the software
     or recent scholarly publications enabled by it

    The software should be a significant contribution to the available open source software that either enables some new research challenges
     to be addressed or makes addressing research challenges significantly better (e.g., faster, easier, simpler)
    The software should be feature complete (no half-baked solutions) Minor, ‘utility’ packages, including ‘thin’ API clients are not acceptable

JOSS publishes articles about research software.
 This definition includes software that: solves complex modeling problems in a scientific context
  (physics, mathematics, biology, medicine, social science, neuroscience, engineering); 
  supports the functioning of research instruments or the execution of research experiments; 
  extracts knowledge from large data sets; offers a mathematical library, or similar.
